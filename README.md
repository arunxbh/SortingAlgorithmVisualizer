# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This program organizes randomized data points in three different sorting algorithms and visualizes the process.

## Usage

Use the runnable .JAR file to execute the Java Swing application. Users may use a drop-down menu to select one of three potential algorithms and data points to sort through. Users may also set the speed slider during the sort to change the rate at which the sort occurs.

## Features

This program includes:
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Project Status

Front end application is completely built. I am currently in the process of adding more algorithms (Bubble Sort, Gnome Sort, Shell Sort).
