Hey everyone! This is my first independent coding project and I am so excited to share it with you all.

I build a sorting algorithm visualizer because I was fascinated with the different implementations of how data is sorted. Moreover, I thought it was so cool to see data be sorted using various algorithms. In this program, I have implemented the merge, insertion, and selection sort algorithms. I plan to continue contributing to and growing this project in the future!
